This is Ollie Bown's generative-textures-100 project. At the start of 2022 I set myself the goal of creating 100 generative textures. I'm not a great finisher, so I may just manage 2. I'm placing no pressure on myself whatsoever, and no time limit whatsoever. These are designed to be musical loops that will work great on a techno track (I was especially inspired to do this by revisiting Robert Hood's "Minus" - a true minimalist classic). 

You can do aaaaanything you like with these files. They are licensed under a CC license which says so. It just asks you to attribute me, Ollie Bown. There's a subclause that says if you spell my name right you come back as a wizard in your next life. I also welcome you to ping me on Twitter to let me know of any use you make of the files: @olliebown. But you don't have to.
